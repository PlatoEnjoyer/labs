Almost everyone agrees that William Shakespeare is the greatest
writer in the English language. He wrote more great plays of
different kinds than anyone else in the world. But we do not
know much more about his life than the information that we can
find in legal documents. Most of the stories about his personal
life were written long after his death and we cannot be sure that
they are true. In an honest report of his life, the writer must often
include the words 'perhaps' or 'probably'. Unlike his friend and
rival, Ben Jonson, Shakespeare did not leave a notebook or
publish his opinions on art or politics or religion. His only
published personal poems, his Sonnets, show us his feelings about
a man and a woman, but we are not sure who they were.
For this reason, and because Shakespeare was an actor and did
not go to a university, people have tried to prove that someone
else wrote the plays. But serious students agree that the opposite
is true. Shakespeare became a great dramatist because he was a
professional man of the theatre. He learnt to write plays by seeing
and acting in plays written by others.
Shakespeare is the greatest of all dramatists because his
characters seem real and he included all kinds of people. We
laugh or suffer with them and leave the theatre happy or sad
because of what we have learnt about life. Shakespeare's plays are
not only great literature, but are alive after more than 400 years.
